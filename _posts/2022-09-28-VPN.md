# What is a VPN?
-Virtual Private networks, or VPN, is a secure private network inside a established network, which allows you to be able to access websites without having to follow the rules of the parent network, due to VPN's being incripted
-VPN's are anonymous, meaning that people who own a WiFi network wont be able to see what you due and need to hack into encription in order to see what you do

# Why should people in this class download a VPN?
- PUSD WiFi is very basic, many of the things we do in this class require websites which require a more secure network and better connection
-In general would help you even outside of CS, whenever in a public network (Starbucks, Stores, etc) VPN allows you to get a better connection and can protect you from getting hacked in a public setting

# What VPN should you download?
-In my opinon, for the people in this class Betternet is a good option to use
    -This is because it is free unless you want even more advanced options
    -Can be used daily as long as you dont exceed daily limit of 500 MB (which lets be honest, no one right now will do unless you secretly work for the US government)
    -Has ads, but can be easily skipped
    -Very user friendly
    -PUSD wifi on VPN becomes a lot more secure, can accesses complex websites if needed now
